# BenchwarmersCapstoneProject
This project analyzes a dataset found on kaggle that provided sales information for the video game industry. We used this dataset to simulate a datastream with kafka. Using this simulated stream a SQL database was created and filled the the data from the simulated stream. This database was used to train several different Machine Learning models to predict how well a given game could sell.

# Code
This directory contains all of the jupyter notebook files that we used throughout this project. This includes the Consumer, Producer, ML Moddels, DDL Schema, and DML script used to populate SQL database.
# Dashboard
